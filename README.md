# Linux Basics & Security Labs

This repository contains hands-on labs and documentation created during my
self-study in Linux and basic Cyber Security.

The focus is on understanding how Linux systems manage users, permissions
and privileges, with a security-oriented mindset.

## 🔧 Topics covered

- Linux filesystem navigation
- File permissions and ownership
- Permission representation (rwx and numeric modes)
- `chmod`, `chown`, `ls -l`
- Users and groups management
- `sudo` and root privileges
- Introductory analysis of SUID binaries (educational purpose)
- Virtualization using VirtualBox

Linux fundamentals and basic system security concepts, not automated tools.

All activities were performed manually to strengthen system-level reasoning
and security awareness.
